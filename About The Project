The project titled as “Library Management System”.If any user either staff or student wants to take a book from library, he or she must interact with library management system by proving the credentials (user and password) of the user.
Then LMS ,allows the user to get issues and returns by their own.
Library maintains the details of books that are available in library,details(cerdentials)of users that are already memeber of library.Here,we need two structures to maintain these details.
The interface asks the user to enter his username and password.It verifes the credentials of that particular user.
If entered details are correct,it dispalys two options 1.Issues 2.Returns 3.Query. Otherwise,it dispalys "wrong credentials, Please try again".
If the user choose first option ,the is issued to student by entering book ID.If he selected second  option, student can return book by entering book's ID.This is the process to take and return the book in library by using LMS.
